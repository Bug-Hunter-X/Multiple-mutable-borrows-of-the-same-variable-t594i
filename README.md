This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to mutable borrows. The code attempts to create two mutable references to the same variable, which is forbidden by Rust's borrow checker. This is to prevent data races and ensure memory safety. The solution shows how to refactor the code to avoid this error, using techniques like cloning or using a single mutable reference.
